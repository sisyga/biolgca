Types of LGCA
=============

.. note::

   This section is under construction.

Here we detail the specificities of each LGCA type and the corresponding data structure including figures.


Classical LGCA
--------------

Only one particle can reside in a channel and they are not distinguishable.


LGCA without volume exclusion
-----------------------------

Particles are not distinguishable, but channels can be occupied by an arbitrary number of particles.

Identity-based LGCA
-------------------

Only one particle can reside in a channel. Each particle has individual properties and can be tracked across the simulation.


Identity-based LGCA without volume exclusion
