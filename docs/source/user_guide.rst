   This section is under construction.

Here the LGCA simulator classes will be introduced in detail. The first section details the specificities of each LGCA type and the corresponding data structure including figures. The second 
section describes the different lattice geometries with geometry-specific operations like propagation and how to interpret the coordinates. 
The third section provides a summary of predefined interaction functions.
